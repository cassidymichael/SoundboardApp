- dark mode support (vs just make it only dark mode)
- remove the aspect ratio related tile auto size constraint(s)

- make companion(?) software which I can use which acts as an intermediary keybind input/passthrough? basically so I can set the keybinds in the MiniKeyboard macropad app once, then only use my app to say make the physical macropad button of [the top left one] bind to F13, which then in my app can passthrough something like "Win + H" or maybe even like a few keybinds like typing a few keys, or pressing/holding a key for a specific duration or number of times on a pattern, etc.
