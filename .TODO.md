- sound clips should all be in one folder, not a folder per tile
- make a little info button/icon that when clicked on (or hovered?) explains that all sound files selected get COPIED into this apps library, and also give a button so user can have the app's file library opened locally in win explorer. Also, lets make it so our app keeps track of this internal sound library so we can create a UX about it, like adding new sounds not direct to a tile, but to the library itself, then a per-tile function could be to select a sound from our library OR import a new one (which goes to tile + library).


- Set/Clear keybind functionality for the Stop All button.

- In Tile Settings area, move "Test Sound" button to just be a "Test" button to the right of the ... button under Sound File.
- Make the Tile Settings area slightly wider.. can we also allow user to resize it left/right by dragging the middle edge somehow?
- the right-side scrollbar should be thinner/different, users will just use mouse-wheel anyway, you know?

- in system tray, it shows "Soundboard" on hover immediately.. make it only show on hover after a little bit? and what else does the tray icon do? describe the behaviours for click, right click, etc


- make companion(?) software which I can use which acts as an intermediary keybind input/passthrough? basically so I can set the keybinds in the MiniKeyboard macropad app once, then only use my app to say make the physical macropad button of [the top left one] bind to F13, which then in my app can passthrough something like "Win + H" or maybe even like a few keybinds like typing a few keys, or pressing/holding a key for a specific duration or number of times on a pattern, etc.
